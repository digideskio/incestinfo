Warning: This website contains graphic images of sex between family members. View at your own risk!

The Purpose of **Incest Life**  is to show that for some families, __Incest__ (specifically the consensual kind, known as Consanguinamory) is not a bad thing. There are families that practice it safely and without any abuse. The photos on this website only contain smiles, no frowns.

The Mainstream media and the educational system teaches us to abhor Incest, but those who have tried consensual incest often say it was a positive experience. **Several interviews with actual couples have been taped for incesttaboo.com. These were re-posted to actualincest.com. Both websites are now defunct, but some intact videos now appear on incest.life.**

Many people associate Incest with Birth Defects, but in fact we now have contraception, Plan B, and legal abortion. Consensual incest with proper birth control can form a deep "double love" bond between family members.

Spain, Netherlands, Switzerland, and Japan (among others) have decriminalized consensual incest. We in the Consanguinamorous Community hope the United States will follow suit.
