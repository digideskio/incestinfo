### WARNING: Graphic Content

**Warning:** This website contains graphic images of sex between family members. View at your own risk!

### Purpose

The Purpose of **Incest Life**  is to show that for some families, __Incest__ (specifically the consensual kind, known as Consanguinamory) is not a bad thing. There are families that practice it safely and without any abuse. These families are persecuted by governments and people who are ignorant to the truth.

Rape is rape, whether incestuous or not. We condemn rape, but hold incest in a different category. Ultimately we believe consensual incest, safely practiced at or after the age of consent, should be legalized globally.

### Photos

The photos on this website only contain smiles, no frowns. They come from **actualincest.com**, which was once a "digital safehouse" for incest practitioners. The photos were uploaded by community members to a forum. The website is now offline, but I managed to secure a copy of all photos, through a hack I conducted.

### Videos

The Mainstream media and the educational system teaches us to abhor Incest, but those who have tried consensual incest often say it was a positive experience. Several such interviews with actual couples have were taped for incesttaboo.com as the Incest Taboo series. These were re-posted to actualincest.com. Both websites are now offline, but some intact videos will appear on incest.life in the near future.

### The Birth Defect argument

Many people associate Incest with Birth Defects, but in fact we now have contraception, Plan B, and legal abortion. Consensual incest with proper birth control can form a deep "double love" bond between family members.

### Legalization

Spain, Netherlands, Switzerland, and Japan (among others) have decriminalized consensual incest. We in the Consanguinamorous Community hope the United States will follow suit.
