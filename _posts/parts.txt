part 3

this video is the third in a series about consensual incest I've already
covered in my previous video how the arguments for keeping incest illegal are
provably invalid and based more on people's negative feelings and
misunderstandings than on any solid evidence this video is a follow up of
that about the various penalties that counts and enormous couples face if they
are discovered by the authorities
remember that these penalties are given to people who did nothing more than
falling in love
in the United States insist between cousins is legal in some states and
illegal in others but almost universally it is illegal between people who are
first or second degree relatives often the penalty given is a longer jail term
then would be given to a murderer how is that Justice a murderer deprives his or
her victim of life that is a terrible crime a condescending and risk couple
fall in love and have a relationship and then they get thrown in jail because the
state persecute them
in the United Kingdom Cousins is also perfectly legal
however first and second degree constantly memory is illegal
the maximum penalty is seven years which is a longer sentence than is given to
most child molesters how can it be that somebody can molest a child and be given
less time than a person who fell in love and had a sexual relationship with
another adult again where is the justice in that there isn't any justice because
the law is unjust
across much of Europe it is a similar story although I must point out that
some countries provide safe havens for our people because they have either
decriminalized incest or never had laws against it in the first place
places like the Netherlands and Spain do not have auntie interest laws and some
of us to move to those countries for this very reason that said why should
anyone have to pack their bags and moved to a foreign country just because they
have fallen in love with a family member it's not right and it is not fair
the Islamic world deals with constant in amorous couples even more severely
alongside the jail terms there are floggings and even at times being put to
death
why these people did not home each other they did not have their country or
threaten Islam they simply dissipate the shoe aisle or by sharing their mutual
love
around the world we are threatened and persecuted we have our rights removed
even our very lives may be at risk I live in the West but even my closest
friends and all my family do not know what I am I was in a relationship with
my father for many years we were happy and very much in love we broke up
because of fear of being discovered and thrown in jail and because he could not
get over the taboo and realize that these laws are in themselves ridiculous
that is the reason this video is so anonymous we faced such horrific
persecution that we did not reveal ourselves
incest is the love that dare not speak its name but it shouldn't be like that
with my knowledge of the subject I want to play my part in helping to change
attitudes and to help unite the global consanguineous community and solidarity
we are what we eat and we should not be ashamed of our identity and sexuality
love is love and punishing love is absolutely insane immoral and outrageous
if you are constantly and immerse yourself if you know somebody else who
is or if you're simply an open minded person looking for more information on
the subject please visit my website at www.sec.gov wordpress.com and also visit
the web sites are linked to in my useful links section you will soon see that you
are not alone you are not a freak you are not a perv heard you are just a
normal person who differs in this one small way.

part 

this is the fourth part of a series of
videos about consensual incest the
previous videos have described up light
around the world how we are persecuted
and prosecuted globally despite there
being absolutely no solid legitimate
argument for keeping incest illegal as a
campaigner for our people
I want to give the public more
information about us to enable them to
give them access to our side of the
story i do this to reduce the amount of
ignorance and fear that people feel
towards us and to help change public
attitudes only when this is achieved can
we become the fully integrated and
accepted part of society that we want to
be we aren't much different from anyone
else
we're contributing members of society
that you never see we are your friends
your neighbors your work colleagues you
makes you speak to on a night out even
possibly your family we exist in every
country within every ethnic and
religious group by necessity we are
secretive but we want that to change
this fourth video is for anyone who has
discovered that a friend or family
member is consenting numerous many
people freak out adhering such news
while most people are ready to accept a
friend or relative if they turn out to
be homosexual those same understanding
and tolerant people suddenly become much
less tolerant and understanding when
they discover that somebody close to
them is having an incestuous
relationship their minds go into
overdrive and they make all sorts of
assumptions which are based on societal
prejudice and misinformation about the
subject
firstly I would urge you not to
automatically assume that one of them is
in any way abusing or taking advantage
of the other this is really the case it
is easy to make such assumptions because
this is all society knows or at least
thinks that it knows if the couple are
happy together and if they are in love
then I really do not see the problem
these people are not hurting anybody
else by being in love and they should be
given the same respect as anybody else
you may wonder how something like this
could happen or why they don't just find
somebody unrelated to them
cells to be intimate with that might
make it easier for society at large but
it is avoiding the issue which is that
there is a relationship that is making
people feel uncomfortable
where does the discomfort come from it
comes from ignorance and Prejudice it
comes from it being outside the scope of
one's imagination to perceive these
relationships as healthy and happy
why should somebody have to find
somebody else when they are already with
somebody that they are in love with
logically they shouldn't have to
and it is cruel to force them to how
would you like it if you were banned
from being with your partner or spouse
think about that for a moment
it helps to try to put yourself in our
shoes for a moment why inflict that sort
of pain on somebody else when there is
absolutely no valid reason for doing so
people fall in love all the time and it
is the same for incest couples whether
it is a GSA situation or not the process
of falling in love is the same and the
feelings are very real often very
intense the family bonding the lovers
bond are experienced at the same time
it's a unique and special kind of love
referred to as double love within the
community most people I think find the
concept to be difficult to understand
because it is outside what most people
can imagine yet it exists and it makes
these relationships and like any other
by comparison to many of us it makes
other relationships lacked up this is
because the family bond aspect is
missing this is why when people say we
should just find somebody else because
there are plenty more fish in the sea
I point out that we just don't want to
and why should we when we are happy and
these relationships i understand that
this may be very difficult for you to
get your head around and i am glad that
you're listening to this video and at
least trying to understand that alone
makes you a far better person that
somebody who simply calls in the police
I will advise you to ask these people
the questions you need to know
don't give them the third degree or
start shouting at them just sit down and
have a conversation
listen to them
and you may be pleasantly surprised at
the answers they give you remember these
are the same people you've always known
they don't morph into pervert or
monsters because their sexuality is not
what you expected it to be
also do not fear that because they are
concerned gonna risk that they will
necessarily be interested in having
sexual encounters with other family
members that is not the case if you're
straight you won't want to sleep with
every member of the opposite sex if
you're gay or lesbian you won't want to
sleep with every member of the same sex
and you guessed it concentration and
most people don't want to sleep with
their whole family either the mutual
attraction has to be there for anything
to happen
give your consent in amorous friends and
family the love and acceptance they
deserve even if it feels weird to you at
first
believe me if they came out to you they
trust you to be able to do just that if
they came out to you
they took a great risk in doing so
because you could potentially be the one
to land them in jail please don't do
that
mutual understanding and respect is what
is needed not condemnation it is the
condemnation that is the cause of family
rifts when incest is discovered not the
relationships themselves
furthermore if you are simply suspecting
that somebody may be in such a
relationship but you are not sure I
would advise you to not say anything
until you do know for sure if you're
wrong it could make you look rather
foolish and if you're right you will put
the couple on the defensive where they
will go further into the closet and you
will never know for sure what people put
up with so much prejudice and hate
already could you be one to accept us
for what we are

part 

this is the fifth video in a series about consensual incest my last video
was some information and advice for friends and family of the constant gerin
risk couples this video is intended as help and advice for people who are
concerned can enrich themselves if you are currently have in the past been in a
relationship with a family member or if it is something that you have seriously
considered or are currently considering this is for you
firstly I want you to know that you are not alone there are many of us from all
walks of life you may have spent time on-line searching for others only to be
bombarded with ridiculous and offensive pornographic websites the people who
frequent such wild places and not consanguineous they are fetishists they
don't care if you want advice or support it ruins their sexual fantasy on top of
that extend guinier people see those websites and think Oh my god those are
disgusting incest people and yet they barely realized that there is a genuine
community the girls fetish sites do not gated or speak and a few others are
speaking out the genuine concern korean-american community and it is to
us you should come for solidarity and support it is easy to feel very alone
when bombarded with porn and a bunch of morons telling stories that sound like
they were lifted from a porn script I felt that way myself along time ago
before the real community was formed I know what the lonely path that is what
you need not walk it to we're here now for anyone who needs us
the largest hurdle that most if not all of our people face at one time or
another is self acceptance society tells us that we must find a partner outside
our family unit and that if we don't bid out then we have a pervert or monster
when your sexuality is so taboo that even talking about it is too boo it's
enough to give anyone a complex many constant in amorous people think of
themselves as dirty or perverted I think that is a pretty sad story because I
love is just that love as you will come to understand if you join us you are not
broken bed or perverted you are a normal person who is in love when you realize
how broken I justice system is and how irrational human beings can be when they
legislate based on their disgusted other people you will no longer feel guilty
you can and will learn to love yourself just as you are your self esteem will
improve and you will become more confident as a person and consent gonna
dress and proud I would not change what I am even if I could because I am what I
was meant to be just being around others who understand you will make a huge
difference to your life and how you see yourself
then there is the prejudice we face having to hide our true nature to the
outside world is daunting and it reinforces the feeling that we're doing
something wrong that prejudice is based on misinformation and fear of what they
imagine we represent they see us as a threat to the family unit and structure
they fear that we are abuses and pedophiles which is clearly insane as I
pointed out in part two of this series
don't let their hate become your self hate you are beautiful just as you are
you shouldn't have to change for anyone it is their attitude towards us that is
the problem not our sexuality
I realized that right now this may be difficult for you to hear or except if
you have internalized societal expectations but that is the harm that
has been done to you by the state and society I want to help you and all
concerned can embarrass people around the world I want to show you the way
home there is a community for you and you never have to be alone again
first visit my website at WWW dot com singin' in redirect wordpress.com and
read my articles then go to the useful links section the you will find two
other blogs of extremely good quality with even more information
my blog is new those have been going for years you will also find one link to a
form which is run by the owners of those two blogs obviously read the rules
before joining and be sure to participate in discussions communities
work best in everyone talks to each other even if you've never discussed
this part of your life with another human being isn't that all the more
reason to do so I'll leave it to you but community and solidarity is therefore
you should you want or need it.

part 

this is the sixth video in the series about consensual incest this one is
about what it is like to become synonymous and what kind of lifestyles
we must lead to protect ourselves from persecution and prosecution it deals
with how we handle living in a society that both denies our existence and hates
us it also deals with what it is like to be romantically involved with a family
member working attraction israelis' I will also outline the debate within the
community itself regarding whether or not constantly Annamarie as a sexual
orientation or not as even within the community
opinions vary
the public-at-large imagine that incest couples are in some way freaky that they
are plagued by mental illness that causes their attractions with that they
are just bad or broken even that they are retarded nothing could be further
from the truth
speaking as an insider I can tell you that we are as intelligent normal and
average as any other group of people we come from every walk of life for every
socioeconomic status and from every ethnic and religious group you process
on the street all the time and you never know it it is only this one small part
of our lives that are different in all other aspects we are the same as
everyone else
from our perspective on relationships a happy and healthy just like everyone
else we fall in love and want to be together since there are two types of
content in a hurry I will cover them separately for the purposes of
describing what he just like
genetic sexual attraction is when people who are separated when one or both
people involved was a small child and then reunited Adam's fall in love with
each other during the process of getting to know each other as long lost family
this can be very confusing at first for these people as very often they have
never even thought about having a consanguineous relationship and often
the Western mark effect is still present for them with regards to the family
members they were actually brought up by all along side so for the GSA couple
they know that they are genetically related and it doesn't quite feel the
same as a family relationship where there wasn't the separation the proper
family bond for these couples can be established either before during or
after the romantic relationship has been established
with known GSA constant in a tree the family members know each other extremely
well from the outside and for this reason the romantic attraction grows as
an extension of the existent family bond from the outset the couple has to be
both family and lovers to each other these roles actually reinforce each
other to create a very strong deep and intense bond many incest couples find
the process of getting their head around their feelings for each other very
confusing time
in both kinds of Constantine Andrey the double of bond exists that is loved his
family and love is alive as both groups also experienced the same hatred and
prejudice from society who just do not understand how or why these
relationships come to be my best answer is that these relationships happen for
the same reason that any other type of relationship happens people fall in love
and so what if that love is with a family member should there be anyone
else's business of course not
the outside world wonders what the attraction is and why we don't just go
and find somebody else
firstly why should we we're happy
secondly for some of us most often those who have been involved in on GSA
constantly Annamarie we find out normal relationships lack the same depth as
contango numerous ones this is because we can't experience the double love with
anyone who is not related to us this is the category I fall into personally and
i felt it important to explain it
this fact sparks the debate about whether or not constantly in Amory as a
sexual orientation or not I would argue that for some of us it is and for some
of us it isn't I would consider it my orientation because although I've tried
normal relationships they never felt right for me with the family bond being
missing others are equally happy to be with somebody who is related or
unrelated to them
well there is no official comment terminology to label those people I
would suggest the term this anger numerous because they are both concerned
gonna dress and extend and increase at the same time a bit like how about
sexual is both straight and gay at the same time most GSA people don't consider
their relationships to be indicative of a sexual orientation because they don't
feel any attraction to family members that they were never separated from
in the end it doesn't matter whether it is an orientation or not what does
matter is that there is a small but significant number of people who are
discriminated against simply for falling in love with a family member for both
groups the prejudice they face is how I know firsthand what it is like to have
to lie to everyone and hide such a significant part of my life just to stay
safe and out of jail to be constantly an amorous means to live a life of secrets
and for many the secrecy and ignorance only adds to the shame and guilt that
people are forced to feel can you even begin to imagine what it would be like
to be so much in love and yes to be unable to tell a single soul can you
imagine what it would be like if society branded your whole people a bunch of
perverts and deviance can you imagine what it would be like being found out
and being treated as a sex offender
this is what our community face daily just for being in love
it shouldn't be this way anyone listening to this with even a small
amount of empathy should be able to understand how we are feeling and
recognize that such prejudice is wrong and unjust I am arguing that we deserve
equal rights the right not to be persecuted and prosecuted by the state
the right not to be harassed by vigilantes the right to live in peace
and and ultimately the right to marry if we choose to and to be recognized and
protected as a minority group
long way from this dream but little by little people who are sympathetic to
applied can help for instance they could send links to my blog YouTube channel
two friends on social networking websites you could post links on the
forums they frequent online you could be the first to be a listening ear and a
friendly face to a concert in amorous couple should they risk coming out to
you there are lots of little things like this that people could do to help raise
awareness of the issues we face I know that being an ally in this way takes
courage but if you can help please do so you have our gratitude

part 

this is the seventh video in my series about consensual incest this explains
how people who are concerned gerin risk are able to overcome the unnecessary
shame and guilt that society forces on to them it is a huge problem for many
people within these beautiful relationships the defeat of prosecution
and the scent of doing something wrong and rob them of their own sense of
self-worth and happiness
I've already had a much to say about the unfairness and injustice within the
current aunty insist laws yet just stating that these laws are an injustice
doesn't tend to help people all that much that's because people feel that if
something wasn't wrong then it wouldn't be legal
where does this sense of roundness come from it comes from society why does
society think that incest is wrong because they are ignorant about the
subject and have listened to other equally ignorant sousa's repeating the
mantra that it is sick
wrong and disgusting to a greater or lesser degree all people absorb some or
most of the norms of society for better or worse some of these norms are good
and allow us to live our lives safely norms such as you must wait in the queue
at the checkout and norms like you must not steal other people's property are
good and useful guidelines for people on how to behave and respect the rights of
other people such rules legal or informal are a social code for human
beings that helped us to live in a functioning society
of course sometimes the norms of society can be misguided and rule the ante and
says legislation is an example of that it is based on misinformation and
ignorance and a lot of repetition once we understand these sources of these
norms we understand why people react to us in the way that we do and I only hope
of changing the north is by education and reason furthermore just my
understanding that the masses can be wrong sometimes we free ourselves a
little from the mentality of bland complains to one analysis and the
construction of one's own sense of morality based on whether an action
hurts others or not any action hurting other people in tomorrow
anything which does not cause harm is by definition a perfectly moral action in
this way we see that incest is morally OK effect that would show the majority
of people
my understanding that we are not committing some dreadful immoral act we
can stop thinking of ourselves as dirty oppa voted we are normal and we are
beautiful every bit as much as in the other group of people I love is real I
love is true no outsiders can tell us otherwise they imagined but we know we
should not change our self identity is concerned gonna miss people just to suit
the majority to do so would be to kill of our own contribution to the natural
diversity of human relationships and if there is one thing our world needs it is
more diversity of thought and being simply by being what you are especially
if you use the Internet to communicate that you are contributing to the global
diversity that gets people's brains actually thinking instead of reacting
in this way we can be proud of our identity we can stand tall and no with
every fiber of our being that we are concerned gerin risk and there is
nothing wrong with that I double love is perfect and nothing can break her
knowledge of that because it is a part of who we are as people
there is also one more thing I would like to share with you and that is the
the anti interest laws are actually against international law according to
international law all people have the right to family life family life is
people's family members and spouses I think we pretty much cover both these
criteria if we were allowed to marry our relatives then there would also be
spouses
international law also states that governments and companies should not
discriminate on people based on their sexual orientation
well for many of us it is a sexual orientation for which we are
discriminated against which also makes the ante instance laws and legal
international law guarantees the protection of hated minority groups from
harassment and persecution I believe we qualify for the two and yet it is so
often the state that does the harassing and the persecuting
the more you look into it the more you realize that legalizing consent in a
hurry and giving up people their full rights and not forcing them to feel
shame and guilt where none should exist is the right thing to do and in fact is
the only thing to do

part 

this is the eighth video about consensual incest it is a reading of one
of my articles about the nature and nurture debate now we can't send an
interest by design or because of circumstance what makes us who we are
insured now we just born this way or did something like us constantly an amorous
interesting question and no doubt not one that we will find out the answer to
any time soon add to that the fact that it might be nature in some of us and
nurture in others either way the answers and not going to be clear-cut and
definitive rather missus is here to explore different lines of thinking and
possibilities
I argued in previous articles that consoling delivery is an orientation for
some of us in much the same way that homosexuality is an orientation that
would imply of course that it is inbuilt it is something that we just heard
because that's the way we are born it's our nature yet this is not true of all
concerned can embarrass people for many it could be environmental factors that
are an issue like a GSA situation where two people are separated when one or
both kids and then reunited and the separation not occurred the attraction
wouldn't have happened it's nurture in cases such as these
the arguments for nature
some people have no natural aversion to incest the Westmark effect does not take
place for some constantly anonymous persons
some people know from an early age that they are different in this way and
fantasize about it from puberty onwards
this may be in general terms of fantasies about one relative in
particular
many people in Constanta numerous relationships say that they have tried
and have been unfulfilled by relationships with unrelated persons
emotionally they need the family bond to be there was well as the lovers bond in
order for it to feel right and normal to them
many constant can immerse people successfully find a mate within their
family unit which could suggest that it could run in the family as a genetic
trait not that there is necessarily an incest gene only that the gene for
incesto version is not functioning as it would normally
some consanguineous people are attracted to more than one family member
arguments for nurture
some people especially in GSA constant memory on actually incest adverse the
only find themselves with family members they have been separated from and
therefore the Western mark effect works for them in all other instances
people can even unknowingly and subconsciously influence each other
therefore the argument that it might be a genetic trait could be untrue on that
basis
people who are brought up to be more open-minded and liberal might be more
open to the idea than others who are raised in more conservative homes
some people are assigned in america's both consanguineous and exciting dinners
at the same time and have no preference either way if it was nature wouldn't
they have a strong preference one way or the other
this is interesting of course because it shows that even given solid facts there
is more than one way to interpret those facts
for example you could have a brother sister couple in their early twenties
both of them were mutually attracted to each other and experimented together
when they were teenagers neither has seriously wanted to go out and find
somebody else because they're happy together they were raised by open-minded
parents but they still keep their relationship a secret from them just in
case they get a bad reaction because of the sheer strength of the taboo his
sister is also attracted to her uncle her dad and her other brother but won't
go there because she won't cheat on the brother she's already with the brother
has a crush on somebody at work but he won't cheat on his sister because he
loves her more
you could say that the West amok effect was ineffective for this couple because
they are wide up the concierge in Amory by their genes you could also argue that
the pubescent exploration had an influence on them and therefore
significantly reduce the impact of the incest taboo you could argue that
they're open-minded and liberal parents attitudes toward molded them to be free
thinkers and thinking outside the books is required for consent in a hurry to
occur you could say that the system is fully fledged constantly and embarrassed
by nature because she is attracted to several members of her family but you
can't say the same for the best sanguine rose brother who feels attracted to an
unrelated women at work one could argue that they are both properly constantly
anonymous because neither has seriously considered having a real relationship
with an unrelated person
see how complicated it gets when you try to apply the nature nurture debate to
just one relationship that looked like a simple case of below his romance to
apply the debate to the whole community would generate so many contradictory
lines of thinking that the whole project would become the huge tangled mass of
confusion
the only conclusion I can draw from any of this is that both nature and nurture
play a part in constant in Amory it is more nature of some of us especially
those who have been involved in on GSA constant gonna marry and for those who
feel it's their nature it is ok to consider it an orientation most GSA
concert pianists would say it is the situation of being separated that causes
it with them
not any inbuilt preference and so it is mostly nurture for that group it's all
very interesting and thought-provoking to say the least
