Warning: This website contains images of sexual nature. Not for the "feint" of heart.

The Purpose of this website is to show that for some families, __Incest__ (or better, Consanguinamory) is not a bad thing. There are families that practice this safely and without any abuse. The Mainstream media and education system teaches us to abhor Incest, but those who practice it say otherwise. People who think of Incest think of Birth Defects, but in fact we have contraception, Plan B, and legal abortion now, so that argument is dead.

Is it time for the public opinion on Consanguinamory (consensual sex between family) to change in the U.S.? Game of Thrones weaves it into Center Stage. Spain, Netherlands, Switzerland, and Japan have decriminalized Consanguinamory.
